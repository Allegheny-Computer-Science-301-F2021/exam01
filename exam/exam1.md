### Problem 1
(5 Points)

Short Answer:
In the associated figure of the flights data set, the x-axis has been assigned to "air_time" and the y-axis has been assigned to "distance." There are many qualities of the plot that indicate non-random behavior in the data.

In clear and meaningful language, choose two (2) non-random trends in the plot that you notice. For each trend, discuss how you are sure that the trends in the data exist and that they are not random occurrences.

### Problem 2
(7 Points)


Short answer: In the associated plot, there are data points which are accompanied by a bold, smooth line.

A) What benefits are offered by adding this smooth line to a plot? In clear and
meaningful language, explain two (2) pieces of relevant information that we can
extract from this smooth line.

B) Explain one (1) disadvantage that occurs when observing only the smooth
line, in absence of the data points.

### Problem 10
(10 Points)

Multiple choice: Use rStudio to make a scatter plot of the "flights" data set, as we have done in class. In your code to create the plot, set the _x_-axis to "carrier" and the _y_-axis to "distance" of the flights dataset.

When you run your code, a plot is created in which two apparent outliers that can be found around the _y_ = 5000 magnitude line.

With which two carriers are these points associated?

 - A. "HA" and "UA"
 - B. "B6" and "DL"
 - C. "AA" anbd "MQ"
 - D. "MQ" and "9E"

### Problem 11
(10 Points)

Multiple choice: Use rStudio to make a plot of the "diamonds" data set as we have done in class. Assign the _x_-axis to "carat" and the _y_-axis to "cut." In addition, assign _color_ to "clarity" and _size_ to "price."

Your completed plot should have the cut quantities, "Ideal", "Premium", "Very Good", "Good" and "Fair" running along from the _y_-axis where the data points of these groups are clearly visible.

An "outlier" is defined in this dataset as a point that is removed from the rest of its group and does not touch any other point in its category.

Which group has such an outlier which stands almost one full carat unit away from the the rest of the points of the plot?


- A. "Very Good"
- B. "Ideal"
- C. "Good"
- D. "Fair"

### Problem 12
(10 Points)

Multiple choice: Use rStudio to make a plot of the "diamonds" data set as we have done in class. Assign the _x_-axis to "carat" and the _y_-axis to "cut." In addition, assign _color_ to "clarity" and _size_ to "price."

Analyzing the colors of the data points for the "Ideal" category, which quantities of clarity are (generally) found on the right side of the spectrum?




 - A. The quantities, "VS2", "IF" and "VVS1" are on the right.
 - B. The quantities, "I1", "SI2", and "SI1" are on the right.
 - C. The quantities, "IF', "VVS1" and "VVS2" are on the right.
